    pipeline
        The pipeline usually contains a python script called ``build_object_graph.py`` that uses *meta data* associated with the projects that use the pipeline to create project's object graph and  a ``<object type>.snakefile`` for each of the object types created by the ``build_object_graph.py``. 


    project
        Directory containing so_objects.yaml.

    object graph
        `Object graph` is a structure representing a directed acyclic graph of *objects*  (the :py:class:`.ObjectGraph` is the ``snakeobjects`` implementation of the *object graph* and the objects in the object graph are implemented by the :py:class:`.OGO` class).
